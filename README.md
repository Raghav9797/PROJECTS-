Plagiarism checker in Python
This repository holds a straightforward yet efficient Python script that identifies plagiarism among various text files according to cosine similarity.
How It Works
Plagiarism detection is accomplished by comparing the similarity of text documents. As machines perform well with numerical information, the text is initially transformed into numerical vectors. Subsequently, the vectors are compared via cosine similarity, which is a popular measure in natural language processing.
